/**
 * <b>CurrentAccount:</b> <br/>
 * A transactional account where a client may perform regular deposit and withdrawals,
 * accrue interest and may optionally be allowed to go into overdraft.<br/><br/>
 *
 * <b>Savings Account:</b> <br/>
 * Allows you to create accounts where clients can make deposits and withdrawals when they wish.
 * The interest is posted at the frequency you choose and accrued over time. It doesn't allow overdrafts.<br/><br/>
 *
 * <b>Fixed Deposit:</b> <br/>
 * As the name suggests, fixed deposits have a fixed term after which they should be withdrawn or closed.
 * With this type of product, clients are able to make deposits until the minimum opening balance has been reached.
 * At this point, you can begin the maturity period, during which they will be unable to deposit, but will be able to withdraw.
 * Before the maturity date, you have the option to undo maturity. <br/><br/>
 * <b>Savings Plan: </b><br/>Uses a maturity period like fixed deposits,
 * but once the minimum opening balance has been reached, they will still be able to make deposits,
 * even during the maturity period itself.
 * However, they will no longer be able to make deposits once the maturity period has ended. <br/><br/>
